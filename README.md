## Competition Evaluation Metric

### Custom Two-Stage MAPE Scoring
The competition uses a sophisticated evaluation metric:

**Stage 1:** If >30% of predictions have absolute percentage errors >100%, score = 0  
**Stage 2:** Otherwise, calculate scaled MAPE on samples with APE ≤ 100%

```python
def custom_mape_score(y_true, y_pred):
    # Calculate absolute percentage errors
    ape = abs((y_true - y_pred) / y_true)
    
    # Stage 1: Check high error threshold
    if mean(ape > 1.0) > 0.3:
        return 0
    
    # Stage 2: Scaled MAPE calculation
    valid_mask = ape <= 1.0
    mape = mean(ape[valid_mask])
    valid_fraction = mean(valid_mask)
    scaled_mape = mape / valid_fraction
    
    return max(0, 1 - scaled_mape)
```
